Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now
</p>
<p>
Backbeat, the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
</p>
<p>
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how
</p>
<p>
Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall
</p>
<p>
Today was gonna be the day

Realized what you're not to do

So you sailed away
Into a gray sky morning.
Now I'm here to stay,
Love can be so boring.
Nothing quite the same now,
I just say your name now.
</p>
<p>
But its not so bad,
You're only the best
I ever had.
You don't want me back.
You're just the best
I ever had.
</p>
<p>
So you stole my world,
Now I'm just a phony.
Remembering the girl
Leaves me down and lonely.
Sending in the weather
Make yourself feel better.
</p>
<p>
But it's not so bad,
You're only the best
I ever had.
You don't need me back.
You're just the best
I ever had.
<p>
<p>
And it may take some time
To patch me up inside.
But I can't take it
So I run away and hide.
And I may find in time
That you were always right.
You're always right.
</p>
<p>
So you sailed away,
Into a gray sky morning.
Now I'm here to stay,
Love can be so boring.
What was it you wanted?
Could it be you're haunted?
</p>
<p>
But its not so bad,
You're only the best
I ever had.
I don't want you back.
You're just the best
I ever had.
</p>
<p>
The best I ever had.
Best I ever had.

The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah
</p>
<p>
I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again
</p>
<p>
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find
You and I collide
</p>
<p>
I'm quiet you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind
</p>
<p>
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find
You and I collide
</p>
<p>
Don't stop here
I've lost my place
I'm close behind
</p>
<p>
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find
You and I collide
</p>
<p>
You finally find
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide

She said "I don't know if I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me, and I feel like something's gonna give
And I'm a little bit angry"
</p>
<p>
Well, this ain't over
No not here, not while I still need you around
You don't owe me, we might change
Yeah we just might feel good
</p>

I wanna push you around
Well I will, well I will
I wanna push you down
Well I will, well I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you for granted
Yeah, well I will

She said "I don't know why you ever would lie to me
Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me when my face don't seem to want to shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty"
</p>
<p>
Well, don't just stand there
Say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated, I've been wronged
And you, you don't know me
I can't change, I won't do anything at all

I wanna push you around
Well I will, well I will

Oh, but don't bowl me over
Just wait a minute, well I kinda fell apart
Things get so crazy, crazy
Don't rush this baby
Don't rush this baby, baby, baby

I wanna push you around
Well I will, well I will
I wanna push you down
Well I will, well I will
I wanna take you for granted

If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Chasing cars
Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see

Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

Turn into something beautiful
